Paste-To-File is a simple Python programs that lets you paste image or text from your clipboard straight into a file. A roundabout way to achieve similar thing is to firstly paste the content of the clipboard into notepad or paint app if it's an image data and saving it. For extra simplicity, this program adds a new command item to Explorer's right-click context menu to paste clipboard items into the directory the right-click is placed on.

## Installation

Installation is as easy as running the installer which could be downloaded from the <a href=https://github.com/Neek0tine/Paste-to-File/releases/tag/v1.0.0> releases </a> page. <b>Uninstallation can and should be done using Windows uninstaller </b> to not leave any registry files leftovers. If a broken uninstallation has occured and the context menu command still exists after the Program Files (x86)/Paste-to-File directory deletion, you can run `delete_reg.py` directly from the `src` folder to remove it; keep in mind that it requires the `winreg` Python library and administrator privileges.

- `pillow`
- `pywin23`
